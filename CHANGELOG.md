# Changelog — Mamut2026 TDVRP BKS

All notable changes to the `Mamut2026` TDVRP instances and best-known solutions (BKS) are recorded here. Objective: **Duration** (duration minimization — the depot departure time of each route is a decision variable). Costs are the authoritative output of the canonical checker (`mamut_routing_lib.td.check_td_solution`): exact IEEE-754 double arithmetic, no epsilon thresholds, routes in canonical order (sorted by first customer), total summed in that order — so any strict improvement is real.
